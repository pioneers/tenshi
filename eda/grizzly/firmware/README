This code is the firmware for the Pioneers in Engineering Grizzly Bear Motor
Controller. This code compiles for the AVR architecture, specifially the
ATmega32u4. Written by Robert Ou in PiE KitDev Electrical. For further
documentation, consult the wiki page.

=== Configuring AVR ===
The AVR on the Grizzly Bear controller should be configured with lfuse=0xff,
hfuse=0xd9, and efuse=0xfb. This configures the AVR to run with the external
16MHz crystal.

Using avrdude, the AVR can be configured using the command:
$ avrdude -c <prog> -P <port> -p atmega32u4 -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m
  -U efuse:w:0xFB:m
where <prog> is the type of AVR programmer and <port> is the port the
programmer is connected on.

=== Compiling ===
This code requires avr-gcc and avr-libc. On Ubuntu, install the packages
avr-libc, avrdude, and gcc-avr. On Windows, install <TODO> WinAVR and MSYS.
Compile the code by running "make" in this directory. Use "make clean" to clean
the built files. The resulting hex file is in build/programs/firmware.hex .

=== Running ===
Flash the AVR using the following command:
$ avrdude -c <prog> -P <port> -p atmega32u4
  -U flash:w:build/programs/firmware.hex:i
