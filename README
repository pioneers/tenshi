Things needed for compiling:
* coreutils, build-essential, etc.
* tar, bz2, etc.
* python (2.7 recommended)
* nodejs (currently using v0.10.26, from the chris-lea/node.js PPA)
* wget
* pep8
* jshint (install from npm, currently using 2.1.11)
* csslint (install from npm, currently using 0.10.0)
* project-tenshi-tools (get from Jenkins)
* emscripten (get from http://rqou.com/emscripten-bin-18apr2014.tar.bz2)
* avr-gcc (currently using the nonolith/avr-toolchain PPA)
* libX11, Xvfb
* EAGLE (currently using v6.5.0)
* Java JRE
* PyYAML

Running Angel Player: It is recommended to have a separate copy of xulrunner
located somewhere such as your home directory. The command you would need to use
would be something like:
~/xulrunner/xulrunner angel-player/src/application.ini -jsconsole -purgecaches

-purgecaches is required in order to debug JS in-tree (without building and
updating build ID).

Setting up Angel Player debugger:
Angel Player can be debugged by using the Firefox remote debug tools that are
normally used to debug Thunderbird/Firefox OS. To enable this on the Firefox
side:
1. Open the developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Click the "Settings" sprocket in the top-left.
3. Under advanced, enable remote debugging (you may also need to enable chrome
   debugging).

To enable remote debugging in Angel Player, either launch the in-tree version
of the code or set "devtools.debugger.remote-enabled" and
"devtools.chrome.enabled" to "true" in about:config. If for some reason you
already have an application listening on port 6000 on your computer, you can
also change "devtools.debugger.remote-port" to an alternate port.

To connect the remote debugger, select "Tools>Web Developer>Connect..." in
Firefox. Set the host to localhost and the port to 6000 (unless you changed
the port above) and click connect. Until this is fixed, to debug JS, select
"Main Process" and to debug CSS select "chrome://angel-player/content/main.html"
