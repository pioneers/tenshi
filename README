Things needed for compiling:
* coreutils, build-essential, etc.
* tar, bz2, etc.
* python (2.7 recommended)
* nodejs (currently using v0.10.26, from the chris-lea/node.js PPA)
* wget
* pep8
* jshint (install from npm, currently using 2.1.11)
* csslint (install from npm, currently using 0.10.0)
* project-tenshi-tools (get from Jenkins)
* emscripten (get from http://rqou.com/emscripten-bin-18apr2014.tar.bz2)
* avr-gcc (currently using the nonolith/avr-toolchain PPA)
* libX11, Xvfb

Running Angel Player: It is recommended to have a separate copy of xulrunner
located somewhere such as your home directory. The command you would need to use
would be something like:
~/xulrunner/xulrunner angel-player/src/application.ini -jsconsole -purgecaches

-purgecaches is required in order to debug JS in-tree (without building and
updating build ID).
