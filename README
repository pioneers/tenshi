Running Angel Player: It is recommended to have a separate copy of xulrunner
located somewhere such as your home directory. The command you would need to use
would be something like:
~/xulrunner/xulrunner angel-player/src/application.ini -jsconsole -purgecaches

-purgecaches is required in order to debug JS in-tree (without building and
updating build ID).
