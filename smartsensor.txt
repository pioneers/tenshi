========================= Tenshi Smart Sensor Protocol =========================

Layer 1 - Physical layer
########################

The Tenshi Smart Sensor Protocol is arranged as a shared multi-drop bus. The
standard connector used for the bus is a 4 row x 2 column 0.1" x 0.1" pitch
IDC ribbon cable connector with a notch, and the standard cabling is 8 pin flat
0.05" pitch 28 AWG ribbon cable. The impedance of the cable should be
reasonably around 120 ohms, but the exact value is not critical (most ribbon
cable of these dimensions is suitable). The pinout of the connector is as
follows:

    Top view looking down at PCB:
     ___________
    |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
    | +5    GND |
    | A+    A-  ¯¯|
    | B-    B+  |¯¯
    | GND   +5  |
    |___________|
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The two +5 and GND lines are connected together. They are capable of supplying
an estimated maximum of 1.5A combined. Voltage output may vary by an estimated
+-10%. The A+/A- and B+/B- lines are RS-485 differential pairs with an output
swing of 5V under no load. The "A" differential pair is always an output from
the master controller to the smart sensors. The "B" differential pair is always
an input from the smart sensors to the main controller. The RS-485 lines do not
have the standard biasing resistors and therefore idle at 0V/0V. This requires
"failsafe" capable transceivers. 120 ohm terminators are present on the main
controller board. It is currently TBD whether bus terminators must be attached
to the far end of the cable.

Cables must originate at the main controller board and terminate at either a
smart sensor or a (TBD if required) bus terminator. The main controller board
should not be connected in the middle of a multidrop cable. Cables must have
all connectors crimped with the notch facing the same direction (left/right)
and the same side (top/bottom).

At this point, there is no support for crossover cables to allow smart sensors
to talk to each other independently of the main controller or for robots to
talk to each other. There is also currently no provision for active repeaters
or hubs.

The maximum number of devices on each bus is nominally 32, but a safe maximum
limit is 8. The RS-485 transceivers should theoretically support cable lengths
of at least 100', but a safe maximum limit is 40'.

The signalling above the RS-485 layer is asynchronous serial at 1 Mbaud
(1000000 bits per second) 8n1 LSB first. Therefore, each bit time is 1 us and
the total time for a byte is 10 us. RS-485 transceivers are enabled only when
bytes are actively being transmitted.

Layer 2 - Link Layer
####################

The Tenshi protocol link layer consists of a stream of packets or frames.
Frames are delimited with 0x00 bytes. All multi-byte values are transmitted
in little-endian byte order (LSB first).

The Tenshi protocol bus has the following possible states:
* Inactive
* Maintainance
* Enumeration
* Active
Each of these states will be described in detail below.


Inactive state: The master controller is not connected, crashed, booting, or
otherwise not driving the bus. The bus idles at 0V/0V (logic level high).


Maintainance state: The master controller is performing some type of
maintainance operation using the bus. The protocol used in this state is
half-duplex and controlled by the main controller. The main controller can send
request frames to the bus and one particular device may optionally transmit a
response. Devices cannot transmit data to the master without the master
initiating the request for data. Responses will time out after TBD milliseconds.
Both TX (from controller) and RX (to controller) frames are encoded using 
Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS). The frame format is as follows:

    Maintainance state frame format:
    |---------------------------------------|
    | 0x00 | type | length | <COBS payload> |
    |---------------------------------------|

Every frame contains a leading 0x00 byte, a type byte (cannot be 0x00), a
length of the entire and an optional COBS-encoded payload. type is 1 byte and
must have its MSB set for maintainance frames. len is 1 byte and may range from
[3,255].

The following range of type bytes are allocated:
* [0xD0-0xDF] - high-level identification and configuration
* [0xE0-0xEF] - debug
* [0xF0-0xFD] - enumeration
* 0xFE - ping/pong
* 0xFF - reset all devices

Several examples of maintainance frames follow:

Type 0xAA, no payload:
0x00 0xAA 0x03

Type 0xAA, payload of length 1 containing "0xDD":
0x00 0xAA 0x05 0x01 0xDD

Type 0xAA, payload of length 2 containng "0x00 0xEE":
0x00 0xAA 0x06 0x01 0x01 0xEE

Maintainance frames do not contain link layer CRCs, but CRCs may (will likely)
be implemented by higher layers of the protocol.

The master may choose to send maintainance frames during any bus state. The
format of maintainance frames is designed to be recognizable in active mode.
Note that sending maintainance frames disrupts active mode and the bus is
considered to have transitioned to maintainance mode if any maintainance frames
are sent during active mode. The master must perform the appropriate actions
to reestablish active mode (if desired).

Upon reception of a 0xFF-type maintainance packet, slave devices should flush
their internal state and return to an unconfigured state ready to receive
commands. Slave devices must shut off their transceivers.

Upon reception of a 0xFE-type maintainance packet, the addressed slave device
should reply with the same payload data. The structure of a ping request is
8 bytes of device unique ID followed by an arbitrary amount of data (can be 0).
Devices should respond with a 0xFE packet with the same data without the 8
bytes of unique ID.


Enumeration state: The master controller is trying to identify all the
connected devices. All devices on the bus must be assigned a unique 64-bit
serial number. The purpose of enumeration is to discover the serial numbers of
all attached smart sensor devices. Note that enumeration must be explicitly
requested. At this time, there is no ability to dynamically detect new devices
on the bus without trying to enumerate them.

Enumeration state uses maintainance frames to perform various enumeration
operations. The following type IDs are defined:
* 0xF0 - enter enumeration
* 0xF1 - exit enumeration, return to normal operation
* 0xF2 - enumeration select

Enumeration state is entered when the master sends a maintainance frame of
type 0xF0. The payload must contain a COBS-encoded version of the magic bytes
"0xE6 0xAD 0xBB 0xE3 0x82 0x93 0xE3 0x81 0xA0 0xE4 0xB8 0x96 0xE7 0x95 0x8C
0xE6 0x88 0xA6 0xE7 0xB7 0x9A." The purpose of a magic string is to ensure that
enumeration mode is not accidentally entered because enumeration mode operates
the bus in a different manner.

Upon receiving the command to enter enumeration mode, a slave device must
turn on its transmitter and drive a logic level 0 onto the bus. The device
should only respond to enumeration select, enumeration exit, and bus reset type
packets until it leaves enumeration mode. The slave device should reset
internal protocol-related state. This command must have its payload set to
"0xE6 0xAD 0xBB 0xE3 0x82 0x93 0xE3 0x81 0xA0 0xE4 0xB8 0x96 0xE7 0x95 0x8C
0xE6 0x88 0xA6 0xE7 0xB7 0x9A."

Upon receiving the command to exit enumeration mode, a slave device must turn
off its transmitter and return to an idle state ready to receive commands. This
command does not have a payload.

Upon receiving the enumeration select command, a slave device must turn off its
transmitter iff its unique 64-bit ID bitwise-anded with the transmitted mask is
equal to the transmitted value. The structure of the payload is 8 bytes of
unique ID mask followd by 8 bytes of unique ID value. The slave device should
perform the test "<my ID> & <mask> == <value>" and disable its transmitter iff
this test is true.

Enumeration protocol:
The main controller may use the enumeration commands to discover slave devices
using any algorithm it chooses. The preferred algorithm is a radix tree/binary
search algorithm. This section requires expansion.


Active state: The master controller is actively receiving samples from slave
devices. In active state, time is divided into intervals of 1 ms that are
referred to as "samples." Each sample is divided into 16-byte segments referred
to as "subchunks." Because each byte requires 10 us to send, 100 bytes may be
sent in each sample. Therefore, each sample is divided into 6 subchunks of 16
bytes (96 bytes) and 4 bytes (40 us) of timing slop and/or reserved for future
expansion.

At the beginning of each subchunk, the master sends the following header:
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 0x00 | in-band signalling  sample#  subchunk# | <length> | <payload> |
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that most of this header is not COBS-encoded. The second byte contains a
flag that is set to 1 iff there is in-band signalling present after the
subchunk header, the current sample number (mod 8) in bits 4-6 (0-indexed),
and the current frame number in bits 0-3 (1-indexed). Note that this can never
result in a value of 0. Iff the in-band signalling flag is set to 1, the length
byte contains a single byte in the range [1,13] containing the length of the
in-band signalling payload. The in-band signalling payload (if present) is
COBS-encoded.

Each slave device is assigned a set of (sample#, subchunk#) blocks that it is
allowed to transmit in. These blocks are allocated using a TBD bandwidth
allocation algorithm. A slave device may transmit only after receiving the
second byte of the subchunk header of the beginning of its allocated block up
to but not including the second byte of the subchunk header of the end of its
allocated block. If a slave device has multiple contiguous blocks, it may
continue to transmit during the subchunk header of all the blocks it owns and
it only needs to send 1 slave reply header. If a slave device has multiple
noncontiguous blocks, it must stop transmitting after each block and must send
a new slave reply header each time.

The structure of the slave reply header is as follows:
    |---------------------------------------------|
    | 0x00 | in-band signalling  length | payload |
    |---------------------------------------------|

The second byte contains an in-band signalling bit in bit7 and a length of the
entire reply packet in bits 0-6. If the in-band signalling bit is set, the
payload is interpreted as some in-band signalling command defined later.
Otherwise, the payload is interpreted as normal sample data. The payload is
COBS-encoded.
